			<p>To begin making FMC routes, it is far easier to first download the AP++ and FMC extensions.  This process can vary depending on circumstance, but the following video explains it well:</p>
			<iframe width="512" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GB2sIqDv1w" title="Install AP++ and FMC Extensions In GeoFS"></iframe>
			<p>With FMC installed, the process I use for making routes is as follows:</p>
			<h3>SkyVector</h3>
			<!-- (9) At least one ordered or unordered list with a minimum of three list items -->
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <a href="https://skyvector.com/">SkyVector</a>, click &quot;Flight Plan&quot;, and fill in departure and arrival airports in the box that shows up.  </li>
				<li>In the top right, click &quot;World Hi&quot; to show high airways</li>
				<li>Type in waypoints from departure and arrival procedures, SIDs and STARs (can be found in <a href="resources.html">Resources</a>)</li>
				<li>Connect the last waypoint of the departure with the first waypoint of the arrival with a path going along the high airways shown on the map</li>
				<li>Copy the waypoints shown in the Flight Plan box, including the airports at either end</li>
			</ol>
			<p>With this, you now have the raw waypoints, which we need to turn into a route.</p>
			<h3>FMC</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Paste the waypoints into the LOAD tab of the FMC extension</li>
				<li>Go through the list of waypoints in the RTE tab, fixing errors by deleting coordinates which are clearly outliers (this is a skill which does come with experience)</li>
				<li>Fill in any deleted or missing waypoints by double clicking their names in SkyVector and copy-pasting the coordinates from the top right (make sure to convert to decimal form)</li>
				<li>While you have the chance, fill in altitudes according to the departure and arrival procedures if needed</li>
				<li>Enter your flight number</li>
				<li>Go to the LOAD tab, press the &quot;Generate Route&quot; button, and copy the FMC route which shows up</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The next steps are optional, as they involve making edits to the route which won't necessarily change anything for you.  These steps only apply if you plan on sharing your routes with others.</p>
			<h3>Customization (optional)</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Open any text editor and paste the FMC route</li>
				<li>Change all the instances of &lsquo;true&rsquo; to &lsquo;false&rsquo; to prevent issues for other users</li>
				<li>Write any notes into your route as needed, keeping them inside quotation marks</li>
			</ol>
			<!-- (25) At least one instance of CSS inheritance being used to style child elements -->
			<div class="warningdiv">
				<h3>Why is my FMC route breaking?</h3>
				<!-- (7) At least one paragraph element with styling applied -->
				<p>If you try loading your FMC route and it doesn't work, it could be for a variety of reasons.  Are some of the waypoints showing up wrong for other people?  That might be because they have different waypoint databases to you, and the &lsquo;true&rsquo; instances in your waypoints is causing your intended coordinates to be overridden.  Fix this by replacing &lsquo;true&rsquo; with &lsquo;false&rsquo;.  </p>
				<p>If the FMC route won't load at all (and FMC will yell at you about this), this is likely a syntax error somewhere in your route.  Perhaps a comma is missing between waypoints, or one of many brackets missing.  The most likely error I've come across is that the wrong quotation marks are used (<span class="monospace">&ldquo;</span>slanted<span class="monospace">&rdquo;</span> instead of &quot;vertical&quot;) when typing in a Google Doc, for example.  </p>
