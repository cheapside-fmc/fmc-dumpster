                                <p>This website is intended for those people interested in the making of premade, load-ready routes for the FMC extension of GeoFS.  It is aimed at users of all experience, from those who have worked with routes for many months to those who are just getting started.  If you have not yet downloaded the FMC extension, it can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/gefs-plugins/fmc-requirejs/releases">Github</a>, and guides for downloading it can be found in the <a href="resources.html">Resources page</a> of this website.</p>
                                <p>For those of you reading this who haven’t the faintest idea what any of the above meant, I might ask you if you are perhaps interested in playing online flight simulators like GeoFS?  Or, if not, then feel free to move on and look at the comment I put under this paragraph :p</p>

                                <h3>Backstory: AP++</h3>
                                <p>For two or three years of those four, one niche I have continually occupied has been IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) flying with the FMC (Flight Management Computer) extension.  To tell the lore, it began with an extension called AP++, which originally acted as an autopilot for the game, and now acts as vestigial tail to the recent in-game autopilot.  Its ability to automatically fly headings and adjust altitude and speed without pilot input proved very useful for a broad user base, so it’s no surprise that it ended up being adopted by everyone from large pilot’s groups to individual flyers like myself.</p>

                                <h3>Backstory: GeoFS</h3>
                                <p>As some context for said users who didn’t have a clue what I’ve been going on about, one of the interests I’ve kept since 2018 (goodness, has it really been four years?) is aviation, which manifests specifically as a continued use of flight simulators.  It was in 2018 that I first found out about GeoFS, a flight simulator with so few features that it could run on a Chromebook.  Though it has gotten more developed and laggier since then, I’ve still tried to participate in whatever way I could, whether that be flying in virtual airlines, flying in group flights on short and long hauls, or even playing air traffic controller at local Bay Area airports.  </p>

                                <h3>Backstory: FMC</h3>
                                <p>The next step, then, was the FMC extension.  Like AP++, this once again simplified operations for pilots.  Instead of adjusting headings and altitudes in order to follow a route, the FMC extension let pilots enter a series of waypoints along with some information about their flight, then only turn on AP++ in order to give FMC the controls.  It was arguably revolutionary for many reasons, among them that pilots could save and load routes for later use.  This feature proved particularly useful to many users, including group flyers who wanted to fly consistently and in-line, and people looking to experience new routes without the hassle of making said routes.  To cater to these new demands, #fmc-routes channels sprung up in various GeoFS Discord servers, letting users create and share routes they’d made.  Those channels were where I first put my FMC routes, and grew a strange, hilariously niche passion which I still carry today with this site.  </p>
