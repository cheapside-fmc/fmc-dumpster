                        <p>If you encounter a problem that you seemingly cannot solve, never forget that someone else will have encountered it before (GeoFS is surely old enough for that).  And sure enough, the above videos all do great jobs of walking users through the sometimes annoying processes of installing the FMC extension and making routes.  Enjoy!</p>
